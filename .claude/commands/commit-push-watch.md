description: Commit, push, and monitor CI until green
---

Invoke the **commit-push-watch** skill to execute the full local-to-CI pipeline.

Stage all changes, create a conventional commit, push to origin, then monitor CI checks using the ci-watcher skill until all checks pass or require intervention.
