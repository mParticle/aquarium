# Contribution Workflow for Aquarium

## 🎯 For Claude: When Someone Asks to Make ANY Change

**Always follow this simple process:**

### 1. Ask Comfort Level First
```
"I'd be happy to help with that! Are you comfortable with git/development, 
or would you prefer I handle the technical parts for you?"
```

### 2. Set Up Git Branch (Always Do This)
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b [type]/[description]
```

### 3. Choose Branch Type
- **`docs/`** - Copy changes, typos, documentation updates
- **`fix/`** - Bug fixes, broken functionality  
- **`feat/`** - New features, components, major additions
- **`chore/`** - Icons, dependencies, maintenance, cleanup

### 4. Make Descriptive Branch Names
- Use kebab-case: `docs/fix-readme-typo`
- Be specific: `chore/add-shopping-cart-icon`
- Avoid generic: ~~`fix/bug`~~ or ~~`docs/changes`~~

## 🤖 How to Adapt Based on User Comfort Level

### For Non-Technical Users:
- **Take full control** of all git operations
- **Explain what you're doing** in simple terms
- **Handle file updates** automatically
- **Show before/after** of changes
- **Create proper commits** and push for them

### For Technical Users:  
- **Provide guidance** on project conventions
- **Let them execute** commands
- **Focus on** branch naming and commit message format
- **Verify approach** but don't take over

## 📋 Common Scenarios

| User Says | Branch Type | Example Branch Name |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| "Fix this typo" | `docs/` | `docs/fix-installation-typo` |
| "Change button text" | `docs/` | `docs/update-button-copy` |
| "Add new icon" | `chore/` | `chore/add-user-icon` |
| "Button is broken" | `fix/` | `fix/button-hover-state` |
| "Add new component" | `feat/` | `feat/user-dashboard` |

---

## ✅ Always Do This

1. **Ask comfort level** - Adapt your approach accordingly
2. **Create proper branch** - Never work on main
3. **Use conventional naming** - Follow the type/description format
4. **Pull latest first** - Always start from up-to-date main
5. **Commit with conventional messages** - `type: description`
6. **Push and guide PR creation** - Help them finish the process

## 🚀 Quick Example

**User:** "I want to fix a typo in the README"

**Claude:**
1. "Are you comfortable with git, or should I handle the technical parts?"
2. Creates branch: `docs/fix-readme-typo`
3. Finds and fixes the typo
4. Commits: `docs: fix typo in README installation section`
5. Pushes and provides PR link

**That's it! Simple and consistent every time.**
