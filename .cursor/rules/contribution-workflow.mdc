# Contribution Workflow for Aquarium

## 🎯 For Claude: When Someone Asks to Make ANY Change

**Always follow this simple process:**

### 1. Ask Comfort Level First
```
"I'd be happy to help with that! Are you comfortable with git/development,
or would you prefer I handle the technical parts for you?"
```

### 2. Set Up Git Branch (Always Do This)
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b [type]/[description]
```

### 3. Choose Branch Type (Must Start With One Of These)
- **`feat/`** - New features, components, major additions
- **`ci/`** - CI/CD pipeline changes, build automation
- **`fix/`** - Bug fixes, broken functionality
- **`docs/`** - Copy changes, typos, documentation updates
- **`test/`** - Adding or updating tests
- **`refactor/`** - Code refactoring without changing functionality
- **`style/`** - Code formatting, styling changes
- **`build/`** - Build system changes, dependencies
- **`chore/`** - Icons, maintenance, cleanup tasks
- **`revert/`** - Reverting previous changes
- **`dependabot/`** - Automated dependency updates

### 4. Make Descriptive Branch Names
- Use kebab-case: `docs/fix-readme-typo`
- Be specific: `chore/add-shopping-cart-icon`
- Avoid generic: ~~`fix/bug`~~ or ~~`docs/changes`~~

## 🤖 How to Adapt Based on User Comfort Level

### For Non-Technical Users:
- **Take full control** of all git operations
- **Explain what you're doing** in simple terms
- **Handle file updates** automatically
- **Show before/after** of changes
- **Create proper commits** and push for them

### For Technical Users:
- **Provide guidance** on project conventions
- **Let them execute** commands
- **Focus on** branch naming and commit message format
- **Verify approach** but don't take over

## 📋 Common Scenarios

| User Says | Branch Type | Example Branch Name | Commit Message |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| "Fix this typo" | `docs/` | `docs/fix-installation-typo` | `docs: fix typo` |
| "Change button text" | `docs/` | `docs/update-button-copy` | `docs: update button copy` |
| "Add new icon" | `chore/` | `chore/add-user-icon` | `chore: add user icon` |
| "Button is broken" | `fix/` | `fix/button-hover-state` | `fix: button hover state` |
| "Add new component" | `feat/` | `feat/user-dashboard` | `feat: add user dashboard` |
| "Update tests" | `test/` | `test/add-login-tests` | `test: add login tests` |
| "Refactor utils" | `refactor/` | `refactor/clean-utils` | `refactor: clean utils` |
| "Fix CSS spacing" | `style/` | `style/fix-button-spacing` | `style: fix button spacing` |

## ✅ Always Do This

1. **Ask comfort level** - Adapt your approach accordingly
2. **Create proper branch** - Never work on main
3. **Use conventional naming** - Follow the type/description format
4. **Pull latest first** - Always start from up-to-date main
5. **Commit with short, clear messages** - `type: short description` (under 7-8 words)
6. **Push and guide PR creation** - Help them finish the process

## 🚀 Quick Example

**User:** "I want to fix a typo in the README"

**Claude:**
1. "Are you comfortable with git, or should I handle the technical parts?"
2. Creates branch: `docs/fix-readme-typo`
3. Finds and fixes the typo
4. Commits: `docs: fix README typo`
5. Pushes and provides PR link

**That's it! Simple and consistent every time.**
