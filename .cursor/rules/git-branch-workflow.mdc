# Git Branch Workflow and Naming Conventions

## 🎯 For Claude: Always Start New Work with Proper Branch Setup

**When someone asks to make ANY change to the aquarium project, ALWAYS:**

1. **Ask about their technical comfort level first**
2. **Set up a proper git branch before making any changes**
3. **Use conventional naming based on the type of change**

## 🌿 Branch Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Get to Clean State
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main
```

### Step 2: Create New Branch with Conventional Name
```bash
git checkout -b [type]/[description]
```

## 📋 Branch Naming Conventions

### Format: `[type]/[description-in-kebab-case]`

| Type | When to Use | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **`feat/`** | New features, components, or major functionality | `feat/user-dashboard`<br>`feat/new-table-component`<br>`feat/advanced-search` |
| **`fix/`** | Bug fixes, corrections, broken functionality | `fix/button-hover-state`<br>`fix/table-sorting-issue`<br>`fix/mobile-layout-bug` |
| **`docs/`** | Documentation updates, copy changes, README updates | `docs/update-installation-guide`<br>`docs/fix-api-examples`<br>`docs/add-component-usage` |
| **`chore/`** | Maintenance, icons, dependencies, cleanup | `chore/add-shopping-cart-icon`<br>`chore/update-dependencies`<br>`chore/cleanup-unused-files` |

### Description Guidelines:
- Use **kebab-case** (lowercase with hyphens)
- Be **descriptive but concise**
- Focus on **what** you're doing, not **how**
- Avoid generic names like `fix/bug` or `feat/new-stuff`

## 🤖 For Claude: How to Handle Branch Creation

### Always Ask First:
```
"Before we start, I need to set up a proper git branch for this change.
Let me pull the latest changes and create a branch with the right naming convention."
```

### Determine Branch Type:
**Ask yourself:** What type of change is this?

- **Copy/text changes, typos, documentation** → `docs/`
- **Broken functionality, bugs, errors** → `fix/`
- **New components, features, major additions** → `feat/`
- **Icons, dependencies, maintenance, cleanup** → `chore/`

### Create Descriptive Names:
**Good examples:**
- `docs/fix-installation-typo`
- `docs/update-button-examples`
- `fix/table-header-alignment`
- `feat/add-user-profile-section`
- `chore/add-delete-icon`

**Bad examples:**
- `fix/bug` (too generic)
- `docs/changes` (not descriptive)
- `feat/new-thing` (unclear)
- `update/stuff` (wrong type and unclear)

### For Non-Technical Users:
```
"I'm setting up a git branch for your changes. This keeps your work
separate from the main code until it's ready. I'll call it
'docs/fix-installation-typo' - this follows the project's naming
conventions and describes what we're doing."
```

### For Technical Users:
```
"Let's create a proper branch for this. Based on your description,
this looks like a [docs/fix/feat/chore] change, so I'd suggest:
git checkout -b [type]/[suggested-name]

Does that naming look good to you?"
```

## 🔄 Complete Workflow Example

### Example: User wants to fix a typo in the README

**Claude's approach:**
1. **Identify type:** Documentation change → `docs/`
2. **Create descriptive name:** `docs/fix-readme-typo`
3. **Execute workflow:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b docs/fix-readme-typo
   ```
4. **Explain to user:** "I've created a branch called 'docs/fix-readme-typo' for this change"

### Example: User wants to add a new icon

**Claude's approach:**
1. **Identify type:** Maintenance/icon → `chore/`
2. **Create descriptive name:** `chore/add-shopping-cart-icon`
3. **Execute workflow:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b chore/add-shopping-cart-icon
   ```

## ⚠️ Important Rules

### Always Do This:
- ✅ Pull latest changes before creating branch
- ✅ Use conventional naming (feat/fix/docs/chore)
- ✅ Use kebab-case for descriptions
- ✅ Make branch names descriptive
- ✅ Explain what you're doing to non-technical users

### Never Do This:
- ❌ Start work without creating a branch
- ❌ Work directly on main branch
- ❌ Use generic branch names
- ❌ Skip pulling latest changes
- ❌ Use spaces or special characters in branch names

## 🎯 Quick Reference for Claude

**When someone asks to make changes:**

1. **"Let me set up a proper git branch for this change..."**
2. **Determine type:** docs/fix/feat/chore
3. **Create descriptive name:** `[type]/[what-they-want-to-do]`
4. **Execute:** checkout main → pull → create branch
5. **Explain:** Tell them what branch you created and why
6. **Then proceed** with their actual request

This ensures every contribution follows proper git workflow and naming conventions!
