# Simple Contributions to Aquarium

## 🎯 Choose Your Workflow Based on Comfort Level

**When someone asks for help with ANY contribution, always ask first:**

```
"I'd be happy to help you with that! First, let me understand your comfort level:

Are you:
A) New to coding/git and prefer step-by-step guidance?
B) Comfortable with development and want to work more independently?
C) Not sure - just want the easiest approach?

This helps me provide the right level of support for your [copy change/icon addition/bug fix/etc.]."
```

## 🤖 Guided AI Workflow (Recommended for Non-Technical Users)

**Perfect for:**
- Copy/text changes in documentation
- Fixing typos or updating content
- Adding simple content
- Small UI text updates
- Any change that doesn't require deep technical knowledge

**Just tell Claude:**
```
"I need to [fix a typo/update some text/change documentation] in the aquarium project.
I'm not very technical. Can you help me?"
```

**Claude will automatically:**
1. Ask about your comfort level and what you want to change
2. Set up proper git branch with conventional naming
3. Help you locate the right files
4. Make the changes for you (or guide you through them)
5. Verify everything looks correct
6. Create proper commit messages following project conventions
7. Push the branch to GitHub
8. Guide you through creating a Pull Request

**You just need to:**
- Describe what you want to change
- Point out the specific text or location
- Review the changes to make sure they're correct

## 🛠️ Manual Technical Workflow (For Experienced Developers)

### Git Setup
```bash
# Choose appropriate branch type:
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# For copy/content changes:
git checkout -b docs/update-[description]

# For bug fixes:
git checkout -b fix/[description]

# For new features:
git checkout -b feat/[description]

# For maintenance (icons, deps, etc.):
git checkout -b chore/[description]
```

### Make Your Changes
- Edit the relevant files
- Test your changes locally if needed
- Follow project conventions

### Commit and Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"
# or
git commit -m "fix: correct typo in button component"
# or
git commit -m "feat: add new user dashboard section"

git push origin [your-branch-name]
```

## 🎯 For Claude: Handling Different Request Types

### Copy/Text Changes (Most Common for Non-Technical Users)

5. Show before/after comparison
6. Handle commit with proper conventional message format

### Icon Additions
**Examples:** "Add shopping cart icon", "Need new user profile icon"

**Approach:**

4. Handle all file updates (types, constants, exports)
5. Verify icon appears in Storybook

### Bug Fixes
**Examples:** "Button doesn't work", "Component looks wrong"

**Approach:**
1. Ask comfort level first
2. Help identify the issue and locate relevant files
3. For non-technical: Make fixes and explain what was wrong
4. Test the fix if possible
5. Use `fix/` branch naming

### Small Feature Additions
**Examples:** "Add new prop to component", "Add simple functionality"

**Approach:**
1. Ask comfort level first
2. Assess if it's truly simple or needs more planning
3. For non-technical: Handle implementation details

## 🔧 Key Principles for All Contributions

**Always:**
- Use conventional branch naming (`feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`)
- Create proper conventional commit messages
- Pull latest changes before creating branch
- Guide through PR creation process
- Verify changes work as expected

**For non-technical users:**
- Take full control of git operations
- Explain what you're doing in simple terms
- Show before/after comparisons
- Verify their intent before making changes
- Make the process feel safe and guided

**For technical users:**
- Provide project-specific guidance
- Focus on conventions and best practices
- Let them execute commands but verify approach
- Offer suggestions rather than taking control
