# Table Cells Types

### Text

Text cells support 1 or 2 lines of text. Single-line text cells are typically used for concise information like names, identifiers, or short labels. Two-line text cells are used when additional context is needed and can include entry type or ID, allowing for more detailed information without consuming excessive space.

#### Case

We use sentence case for everything except for titles, which use title case. Exceptions are allowed based on a specific project requirements.

#### Truncating Long names

Column with most dynamic and longest copy to typically have flexible. When needed implement cell truncation by ending the text with ellipses and display the full text in a tooltip upon hovering.

#### Cell Alligment

Text content within table cells is typically left-aligned to enhance readability and allow for easier scanning of information.
### Date and Time

To ensure clarity for both US and EU audiences, all dates and times should follow a standard global format. All times are displayed in UTC.

#### Do

- Date: MMM DD, YYYY (e.g., Sep 12, 2024), which removes any ambiguity between US (MM/DD) and EU (DD/MM) formats.
- Time Zone: UTC (displayed once, somewhere visible on the screen).

| Event          | Start Date (UTC) | End Date (UTC) |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Product Launch | Sep 12, 2024     | Sep 14, 2024   |
| Black Friday   | Nov 29, 2024     | Nov 29, 2024   |

#### Don't

- **Mix Date Formats**: Do not use different formats such as `MM/DD/YYYY` (e.g., 09/12/2024, which could be interpreted as either September 12 or December 9) or `DD/MM/YYYY` (e.g., 12/09/2024, which can also cause confusion). Stick to the global format `MMM DD, YYYY` (e.g., Sep 12, 2024).
- **Omit the Time Zone**: Never omit the time zone when displaying times, especially when it might lead to user confusion. Example: Instead of just showing "14:30", show "14:30 UTC".
- **Repeat UTC for Each Entry**: Avoid repeating "UTC" in every row of a table or list. Example: Instead of labeling every row "Sep 12, 2024 (UTC)", use a clear table header like `Date (UTC)` to indicate the time zone for all rows.


### Status

Always use badge components for system status. Reserve tags for actual tags, labels, and environment descriptions (e.g., prod, dev). This ensures clear visual distinction between different information types.

### Cell Aligment

Statuses are left-aligned to create a cohesive and organized table layout.
