# Table Cells 

### Text 

Text cells support 1 or 2 lines of text. Single-line text cells are typically used for concise information like names, identifiers, or short labels. Two-line text cells are used when additional context is needed and can include entry type or ID, allowing for more detailed information without consuming excessive space.
