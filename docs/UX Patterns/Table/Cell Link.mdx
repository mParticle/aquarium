# Cell Link

### Links

#### When to use:

##### Text Links:

Use the Link component [Insert Link] to navigate to other pages, sections, or external resources.

##### Call-to-Actions (CTAs):

Links that serve as action triggers, like "Activate", should also follow these styles.

##### Buttons vs Links:

Use links for navigation and "More Actions" menu or a buttons for actions.
