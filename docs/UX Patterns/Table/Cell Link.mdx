#### When to use:
##### Text Links: 
Use the Link component to navigate to other pages, sections, or external resources.
##### Call-to-Actions (CTAs): 

Links that serve as action triggers, like "Activate", should also follow these styles.
##### Buttons vs Links: 

Use links for navigation and "More Actions" menu or a buttons for actions.
