## Contributing to the Release Process

To make changes to the release process, you can use the `--dry-run` from semantic-release flag to test the release process without actually publishing a new version.

### Required Environment Variables

You will need two environment variables to run the release process locally:

- **NPM_TOKEN**: You can create a personal npm account and use a personal token. Since we are using `--dry-run` it won't try to publish anything so having a valid read-only npm token works.

- **GITHUB_TOKEN**: Create a [GitHub personal access token (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and give it access to the mParticle organization via "Configure SSO" button.

### Testing Locally

After setting both variables locally, run the following:

```bash
npx semantic-release --dry-run
```
