# Commits

## Commit conventions and PR titles

- We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to help automating the release process. Both PR titles and commit messages should follow this convention.
- [This repo is commitizen friendly](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#using-the-command-line-tool) so we can use `git cz` to commit changes.
`npx cz` is also available if you don't have commitizen installed globally.
- We also have a [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) setup to enforce the commit message format.

The standard format for commit messages is as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

The following lists the different `types` allowed in the commit message:

- feat: A new feature (automatic minor release)
- fix: A bug fix (automatic patch release)
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- chore: Changes that don't modify src or test files, such as automatic documentation generation, or building latest assets
- ci: Changes to CI configuration files/scripts
- revert: Revert commit
- build: Changes that affect the build system or other dependencies

In the footer, if there is a breaking change, start your footer with `BREAKING CHANGE:` followed by a description.

## Editor configuration

- **Prettier**: For configuring your editor to play nicely with Prettier, take a look at the [Editors doc page](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors).
- Also, if you're using VSCode you might want to set prettier as the default formatter and also turn on "Format on Save" option.
- **ESLint**: Check [Integrations doc page](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/integrations)
- **Stylelint**: Check [Editor integrations doc page](https://stylelint.io/awesome-stylelint/#editor-integrations)
