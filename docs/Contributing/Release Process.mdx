# Release Process

We use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to automate the versioning and publishing of the mParticle Aquarium component library. Everything is handled by semantic-release, including determining the next version number, generating the release notes, and publishing to npm. You can use the Github Release Aquarium action from the `main` branch to release from it.

> **Important:** Before releasing a version from main, send a message in the #aquarium Slack channel to align it and sync on other changes that can/should be included in the release.

## Step-by-Step Release Instructions

1. **Verify your changes**: Check the [npm package page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mparticle/aquarium?activeTab=versions) or run `npm view @mparticle/aquarium versions` to confirm your changes haven't already been published in a new version

2. **Navigate to GitHub Actions**: Go to the Aquarium codebase and click on "Actions" tab
