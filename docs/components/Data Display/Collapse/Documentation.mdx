# Collapse

A content area which can be collapsed and expanded.

#### Current Usages

**Modal**: In a **complex input form within a modal**, certain fields or options can be hidden under expandable sections to improve usability. 
For example, we use expand/collapse in [Table Filters](https://mparticle.github.io/aquarium/?path=/story/ux-patterns-table-filters--with-complex-filters) where options are displayed within a modal. Initially, only the main category fields are shown, while detailed options or additional settings are hidden under expandable sections. This makes it easier for users to navigate, as they can expand sections only if they need more specific options or details.
