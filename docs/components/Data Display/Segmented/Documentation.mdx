# Segmented

#### Overview

The **Segmented** component presents a compact set of mutually exclusive choices. Each option is easy to scan and the selected value is highlighted to confirm the current state.

#### Small segmented control

Use the small size when the control sits inside dense layouts such as tables or cards with limited space.

#### Large segmented control

Use the large size for standalone toggles where the segment labels need more breathing room and legibility.
