# Card

#### Overview

The **Card** component is a flexible container for displaying content related to a single subject. It combines elements like text, lists, and interactive actions into a visually distinct and structured layout.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Headers and Footers** Supports headers (title) and footers (extra) to add context or actions. Both header and footer is optional.
- **Content Areas** Organize information into a visually distinct and structured layout.
- **Actions** Built-in support for buttons, dropdowns, or custom controls to enhance interactivity.
- **Responsive Layouts** Grid support for displaying multiple cards in a responsive and organized format.
- **Inner Card**The Inner Card is a specialized type of card designed for use within a parent card. It allows you to organize nested or related content, providing a clear hierarchy within the layout.

## Examples

### Basic Card

<Canvas of={CardStories.Primary} />

### Hoverable Card

<Canvas of={CardStories.Hoverable} />

### Card with Inner Card

<Canvas of={CardStories.WithInnerCard} />

## Important: Button Placement

When adding buttons to a Card, use the `extra` prop instead of including buttons in the `title` prop. Buttons placed in the `title` prop will have their focus/active shadows clipped by the card header's overflow settings.

```tsx
// ✅ Correct - Button in extra prop
<Card
  title="Card Title"
  extra={<Button>Action</Button>}
>
  Card content
</Card>

// ❌ Incorrect - Button in title will clip shadows
<Card
  title={<Button>Action</Button>}
>
  Card content
</Card>
```
