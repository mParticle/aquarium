# Tooltip

### Overview
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
The Tooltip is a lightweight, contextual UI element used to display additional information when a user hovers over or focuses on an element. It enhances the user experience by providing supplementary details without cluttering the interface.

### When to use:
- To provide context or explanation for a UI element, icon, button, or data point that may not be immediately clear.
- When more information is needed to explain an action, label, or feature without disrupting the user's flow.
- To guide users with short, helpful messages, especially when onboarding or interacting with complex components.
