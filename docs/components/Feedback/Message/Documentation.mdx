# Message

#### Overview

A **Message** is used to provide feedback to users, such as success, warning, error, or informational updates. It appears at the top and center of the screen and is automatically dismissed, meaning it does not require user action.

#### When to use
- When you need to provide quick, temporary feedback without disrupting the user's workflow.
- When the information is not critical and does not require immediate action.
- For system notifications like form submissions or confirmations.

#### Confirmation Messages

Confirmation messages are used to provide feedback after user actions, such as form submissions, data saves, or API operations. Use success messages for successful actions, error messages for failed actions, and warning messages for situations that require attention.

##### Action Success

Use success confirmation messages to indicate that an action completed successfully.

##### Action Failure

Use failure confirmation messages to indicate that an action failed and may need to be retried.

##### Action Warning

Use warning confirmation messages to indicate that an action completed but may require user attention or review.
