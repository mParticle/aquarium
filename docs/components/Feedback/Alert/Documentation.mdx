# Alert

### Overview

The Alert component is used to display important messages, warnings, or confirmations to users, providing contextual feedback in response to user actions or system events. Alerts are persistent components that remain visible on the page until dismissed by the user and should be used for messages that require user acknowledgment or action.

<Story of={AlertNotProdReadyStories.StorybookNote} />

### Types

The Alert component supports four types: success, warning, and error, each with distinct visual styling to communicate the message's importance and nature.

Success:
<Story of={AlertStories.Success} />

Warning:
<Story of={AlertStories.Warning} />

Error:
<Story of={AlertStories.Error} />

Info:
<Story of={AlertStories.InfoWithoutIcon} />

### Closable

Any alert type can include a close button by setting the `closable` prop to `true`. This allows users to dismiss the alert when they've read and acknowledged the message.

<Story of={AlertStories.WithCloseButton} />

### Errors

Error alerts are used to communicate critical issues or problems that require user attention. They should always include an icon and can be enhanced with titles and expandable details when additional context is needed.

#### Basic Error

Use for simple error messages that require immediate attention.

<Canvas of={AlertStories.Error} />

#### Error with Expand/Collapse

Use when you need to provide detailed error information that can be expanded on demand. This is useful for technical errors that may have verbose explanations or stack traces.

<Canvas of={AlertStories.ErrorWithExpandCollapse} />
