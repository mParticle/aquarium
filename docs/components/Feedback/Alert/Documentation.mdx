# Alert

### Overview

Alerts are persistent UI components used to communicate important information to users. They remain visible on the page until manually dismissed or programmatically cleared. Alerts may be used to inform users of relevant system or process updates that don't require immediate action, or to prompt them to acknowledge or resolve an issue before proceeding.

<Story of={AlertStories.StorybookNote} />

### Alert Types

Four alert types are supported, each with distinct visual styling to convey the message's intent and importance: success, info, warning, and error.

<Canvas of={AlertStories.Success} />

<Canvas of={AlertStories.Info} />

<Canvas of={AlertStories.Warning} />

<Canvas of={AlertStories.Error} />

### Closable Alerts

Alerts can be closable or not, depending on whether users need to dismiss them.

<Canvas of={AlertStories.ErrorWithCloseButton} />

### Alerts with Links

Alerts can include links within the message text. Links should be styled with text color and underlined to maintain consistency with the alert's visual design.

<Canvas of={AlertStories.SuccessWithLink} />

<Canvas of={AlertStories.InfoWithLink} />

<Canvas of={AlertStories.WarningWithLink} />

<Canvas of={AlertStories.ErrorWithLink} />

### Placement in Modals

Alerts can be placed inside modals to communicate important information that users need to be aware of. This is particularly useful for warnings about settings that cannot be changed once saved, or other important contextual information.

<Canvas of={AlertStories.ErrorInModal} />

Alerts can also be shown conditionally, such as displaying an error alert after a save attempt fails.

<Canvas of={AlertStories.ErrorAfterSaveInModal} />
