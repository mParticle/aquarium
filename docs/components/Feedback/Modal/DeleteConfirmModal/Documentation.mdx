# Delete Confirm

#### Overview

A delete confirmation prompts users to confirm before performing destructive actions—especially those that are irreversible. These actions often affect systems or downstream processes and require deliberate confirmation. It typically appears in a modal with:

- A clear warning
- Details about what's being deleted
- Options to confirm or cancel

This pattern is triggered from the [More actions menu](?path=/story/components-feedback-modal-delete-confirm-modal--ux-flow) in a table row or a card.

### When to Use

Use a delete confirmation when the action has significant impact or cannot be undone, such as:

- Deleting a connection
- Removing an audience
- Deleting a data plan

### When to Avoid

Avoid confirmations for low-risk or easily reversible actions, where added friction slows the user down. Examples include:

- Removing criteria from an audience
- Clearing temporary filters or tags
