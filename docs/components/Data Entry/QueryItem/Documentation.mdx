# QueryItem

QueryItems are the essential elements used for query builders such as **Analysis Builder**, **Audience Builder**, or **Prediction Builder**. They work together to form clauses that power query logic.


#### **Types of QueryItems**
There are four types of QueryItems, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **ValueSelector**: Used to select a specific value from a list or range.  
2. **Qualifier**: Defines conditions, such as operators (e.g., equals, greater than).  
3. **Text**: Allows free-form text input for custom queries or descriptions.  
4. **Action**: Provides interactive options, such as adding or removing query items.  


#### **When To Use**
- To build queries for analytical tools like Audience Builder or Analysis Builder.  
- To allow users to create complex conditions with structured query clauses.
