# Select

### Overview
 Select component allows  users to select the necessary record from a list.


### When to use:
- When users need to filter or refine data views based on specific criteria (e.g., selecting records by status or category).
- When there are distinct categories or options that users must choose from during data entry 
- When the list of options is too long to display effectively with buttons, checkboxes, or radio buttons, allowing for a compact, scrollable dropdown.
