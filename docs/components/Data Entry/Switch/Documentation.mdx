# Switch

Used to toggle between two states.

#### **When To Use**
- To represent the switching between two states, such as an on-off state.  
- Use **Switch** when the state change happens immediately upon toggling.  
- Use **Checkbox** for state marking, which typically requires a submit operation to apply changes.
