# Switch
#### Overview
Used to toggle between two states.

#### **When To Use**
- To represent the switching between two states, such as an on-off state.
- Use **Switch** when the state change happens immediately upon toggling.
- Use **[Checkbox](https://mparticle.github.io/aquarium/?path=/story/components-data-entry-checkbox--primary)** for state marking, which typically requires a submit operation to apply changes.
