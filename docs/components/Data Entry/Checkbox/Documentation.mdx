# Checkbox

#### Overview

The **Checkbox** component allows users to select one or multiple options from a list of choices. It provides a straightforward way to toggle selections on or off and can be used individually or within a group of related options.

### When to Use

Use the **Checkbox** component when:
- In lists or forms where users can select multiple items.
- For binary options, especially when changes require saving.
- For active agreements, such as accepting terms of service.

### Default checkbox

Start with the standard checkbox for simple agree-or-disagree prompts.

### Checkbox states

Reference this overview to show each visual state side by side—interactive default, checked, indeterminate, and disabled.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.StatesShowcase} />

### Checkbox groups

Group related choices with `Checkbox.Group` so selections stay in sync. Pair the group with a leading Checkbox to provide a “Select all” control when the pattern fits the use case.

### Disabled with tooltip

Pair a disabled checkbox with a tooltip so users understand why the option is locked or how to gain access.

### Stacked checkbox list

Use individual Checkbox components when you need richer labels and supporting text. Keep the layout vertically aligned to make scanning easy.

### Long consent copy

Pair a checkbox with structured rich text for legal agreements. Highlight the primary sentence and keep supporting copy visually secondary.
