# TreeSelect

TreeSelect is similar to Select, but the values are provided in a tree-like structure.

#### **When To Use**
- Use TreeSelect when data entries are defined in a hierarchical manner.  
- Ideal for scenarios like:  
  - Corporate hierarchies  
  - Directory structures  
  - Categorized data with parent-child relationships  

This control makes navigating and selecting options in complex, nested datasets intuitive and user-friendly.
