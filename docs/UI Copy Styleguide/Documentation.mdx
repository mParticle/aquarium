# UI Copy Styleguide

## Capitalization

Capitalize the entity when referring to the feature or workspace name.

- `Audiences` → the product area or capability  
  Example: “Manage your segments in Audiences.”

Use lowercase when referring to an instance of the entity or the broader concept.

- `audience` / `audiences` → something a user creates or the general segmentation concept  
  Example: “Create an audience for users who viewed a product.”

Additional example:

- `Predictive Attributes` (feature)  
  Example: “View model outputs in Predictive Attributes.”
- `predictive attributes` (instances)  
  Example: “Use predictive attributes to refine this audience.”

**Rule of thumb:** If it’s the name of the feature, capitalize it. If it’s the thing the user creates or uses, keep it lowercase.

## Punctuation

### Commas

- Use commas only when they remove ambiguity.
- Avoid comma-heavy sentences in UI copy; keep structure simple.

### Hyphens

- Hyphenate compound modifiers only when it improves clarity.  
  Examples: “real-time audience,” “event-level data.”
- Avoid over-hyphenating phrases that remain clear without them.

### Apostrophes

- Use apostrophes for possession, not plurals.  
  Example: “audience’s size,” not “audience’s” to describe multiple audiences.

### Quotation marks

- Use sparingly—primarily for referencing literal UI elements or writing examples in guidance.
- Don’t use quotation marks in UI copy unless surfacing text the user must type exactly.

### Ellipses

- Don’t use ellipses in UI copy unless indicating truncated content (for example, text overflow).
- Never use ellipses to create a conversational or suspenseful tone.

### Em dashes

- Avoid em dashes in UI copy; default to clear, direct sentence structure.
- If an em dash is necessary, do not add spaces on either side.

### Exclamation points

- Avoid exclamation points in UI copy; keep tone direct and neutral.

## Acronyms and abbreviations

- Use acronyms only when they shorten text without confusing readers—when in doubt, spell it out.

### Define on first use

- Spell out the full term the first time, followed by the acronym in parentheses.  
  Example: “View your Service-Level Agreement (SLA).”  
  Later references: “You can download the SLA at any time.”
- If space is tight (for example, a button), define the acronym in nearby helper text, a tooltip, or documentation.

### Use only well-known acronyms in UI

- In high-visibility UI (navigation, buttons, labels), use acronyms customers are likely to recognize.  
  Correct: “API keys,” “URL,” “CSV,” “ID.”  
  Incorrect: “Configure your DSR,” unless the audience clearly knows what “DSR” means.
- If the acronym is specific to our product or domain, do not use it alone; spell it out or pair it with a descriptive label.

### Keep the reader in mind

- Prefer clarity over brevity. If uncertain whether users know an acronym, write it out.  
  Correct: “You can send events to third-party tools.”  
  Incorrect: “You can send events to 3P tools.”
- Avoid long strings of acronyms in a single sentence.

### Capitalization and punctuation

- Use all caps for true acronyms and initialisms: “API,” “SDK,” “URL.”
- Skip periods between letters.  
  Correct: “API”  
  Incorrect: “A.P.I.”
- Form plurals with a lowercase “s” and no apostrophe.  
  Correct: “APIs,” “SDKs”  
  Incorrect: “API’s,” “SDK’s”
