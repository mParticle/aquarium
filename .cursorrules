# Cursor AI Rules for Aquarium Project

## Branch Naming Convention

ALL branch names MUST start with one of these prefixes followed by a forward slash:

- `feat/` - A new feature (automatic minor release)
- `fix/` - A bug fix (automatic patch release)
- `docs/` - Documentation only changes
- `style/` - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor/` - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf/` - A code change that improves performance
- `test/` - Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- `chore/` - Changes that don't modify src or test files
- `ci/` - Changes to CI configuration files/scripts
- `revert/` - Revert commit
- `build/` - Changes that affect the build system or other dependencies

### Examples:
- ✅ `feat/expandable-alert`
- ✅ `fix/button-hover-state`
- ✅ `docs/update-readme`
- ❌ `expandable-alert` (missing prefix)
- ❌ `feat:expandable-alert` (wrong separator, use `/` not `:`)

When creating any branch, always use this convention.

## Commit Messages

Commit messages should be short and clear, under 7-8 words, following conventional commit format:
- Format: `type: description`
- Example: `feat: add expandable alert component`
