# Icon Assets

All icons are managed and approved by the Design Team. Do not add any assets that have not been approved to be included into the Aquarium.

## Requirements for all SVGs

- ensure that the viewbox is a square [0 0 20 20]
  - and that there is some internal padding so the image does not touch the edges of the box
- ensure there are no hardcoded colors [unless otherwise desired]
  - and all `fill` has the value `"currentColor"`.
- ensure the svg should not set a `height` or `width` attribute

## Adding a new SVG asset

Add the new asset to src/assets/svg. If your svg file does not have a semantic name (one that describes the function and not the shape), one should be requested from the Designer you received the icon from.
Then add the icon as an import and export in src/components/icons/index.ts
Then add the icon to src/constants/Icons.ts to allow usage in as the `<Icon />` component `name` prop

### New icon colors

If a color is required and not yet available to the `<Icon/>` component, it should be added to both `icon.css` file and the `IconColor` type
